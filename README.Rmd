knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

An opinionated lightweight template for smooth {[targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets)} flows. Inspired by [Mile McBain's](https://github.com/MilesMcBain) {[dflow]()} package.

## Installation

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("toddgrabowsky/tarflow")
```

## Usage

{tarflow} has an embedded RStudio project template that you can use to startup a {tarflow} project, but you can also create the project scaffolding in an existing RStudio project using:

`tarflow::use_tarflow()`

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
# creates the following project scaffolding
./
 |_ _targets.R
 |
 |_ R/
 |  |_functions.R
 |
 |_ data/
```
